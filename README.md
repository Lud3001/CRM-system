# This is a console CRM system for booking the days in a tattoo studio.
# The important thing is that the CRM system is adaptated only for tatoo artists who work with big projects so one day equals one session.
# The aims of the project are: 1. practice working with txt file; 2. adaptating the programme for people who may make small mistakes in fillng the CRM system.
## To prevent some mistakes which administartors might make in the CRM system, "if-else" constructions and "while" loops are used.
### Also in this project working with global keywords belonging to the global scope is practiced.
